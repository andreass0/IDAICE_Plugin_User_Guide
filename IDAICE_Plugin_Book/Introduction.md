# Introduction

## What is the IDA-ICE-Plugin?

The IDA-ICE-Plugin (in the following referred to as "the plugin") enables dynamic multizone climate and energy
simulations with the software [IDA-ICE](https://www.equa.se/de/ida-ice) in the SIMULTAN-Data Model.

## Functionality covered by the IDA-ICE-Plugin

In the current state of development the plugin is able to export:

- Geometry
- Material data
- Shading data
- Internal loads
- Information to build the HVAC-System based on the ESBO-Plant functionality in IDA-ICE

Import:
- Simulation results for all simulation zones of the energy calculation

What we are not able to do right now:

- Export detailed HVAC-System logic
- Import all simulation results

## Project

The development of the IDA-ICE-Plugin is the result of the FFG-research project "Ganzheitliche Gebaeudesimulation"
supervised by Christoph Bauer. Additional information about the project and project outcomes can be found under these

## Authors

Project supervision of the development of the IDA-ICE-Plugin was done by Andreas Sarkany and Bernhard Steiner. Core
development of the software was conducted by Zsombor Jarosi. Additional Feedback and testing was provided by Markus
Steinwender, Paul Track and Thomas Bednar.
